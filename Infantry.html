  <h1>Lizardmen Infantry</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      lizardmen infantry is split between 3 main subgroups within the lizardmen
      species.
      <br />
      First we have the skinks. Not very durable, and not a useful frontline
      unit, however do have the ability to do good damage with good positioning.
      <br />
      Next we have the Saurus. Over 8 feet of savage reptilian muscle. very
      tough, chews through weak melee units, excellent frontline troops.
