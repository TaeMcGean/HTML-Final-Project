  <h1>Lizardmen Infantry</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      Lizardmen infantry is split between 3 main subgroups within the lizardmen
      species.
      <br />
      First we have the skinks. Not very durable, and not a useful frontline
      unit, however have some excellent skirmishing and flanking ability, and is
      useful with good positioning.
      <br />
      Next we have the Saurus. Over 8 feet of savage reptilian muscle. very
      tough, chews through weak melee units, excellent frontline troops.
      <br />
      Finally, we have The Kroxigors. <b>Massive</b> upright standing alligators that
      absolutely smash through melee lines, but can be surrounded and
      overwhelmed if left alone.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>SKINK INFANTRY</h2>

      />
      <br />
      Starting with the humble skink cohort, these blue waves of geckoes are glorified cannon fodder in their default state.
      <br />
      Hovever, this isnt the only thing cohorts have to offer, as at the same tier and building, you can get cohorts with javelins. <br /> they still cant stand up to other infantry in close combat, but this allows them to chase down retreating units and offer small support against already engaged infantry
      <br />

      />
      <br />
      Moving up a tier, we have red-crested skinks. these infantry still dont have the same durability as their saurus bretheren, but make up for it with hammers as large as they are. <br />
      This means that they are very effective against massed infantry, which will be needed, as their master, tehenhauin will be constantly having to deal with skaven attacks.
      <br />

      width="400"
      height="350"
      />
      <br />
      Finally, we have 2 very interesting varieties of skink, these being the chameleon variants. These specialized infantry are effective ambush troops, only uncloaking once the enemy is unable to escape, and firing a hail of blowdarts.
      <br />
      Starting with these, we have the traditional chameleon skink. an ranged unit excellent at sniping artillery and ranged units from the backline. their ability to deploy anywhere on the battlemap means the enemy can never predict your movements.
      <br />
      As for their chameleon stalker variant, they forgo ranged combat in favor of surrounding enemy forces without them even knowing, and charging in at the perfect moment. <br />
      Chameleon skinks have a specialist ranged weapon, which fires explosive rounds while charging into battle, disrupting enemy formations and causing havoc in the enemy lines.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>SAURUS INFANTRY</h2>
      now we can get to the big fellows, the staple of every lizardmen warhost, the unbreaking frontline against the tide of evil.
      <br />
      <img

      alt="Division of saurus warriors"
      width="620"
      height="400"
      />
      <br />
      As there are no saurus units in tier 1, we move right to standard saurus warriors, which have the option of maces and spears. <br />
      i personally prefer maces, as they are effective against everything, but spears are certainly good if you are dealing with a faction that a lot of large units.
      <br />
      Once you hit tier 3, you unlock warrriors with shields. this gives them drastically increased durability both in melee and taking ranged fire. <br />
      personal preferences still apply here, use maces if you like, use spears if you prefer, its not that important.
      <br />

      alt="Saurus temple guards"
      width="400"
      height="210"
      />
      <br />
      Finally, at tier 4 you unlock temple guards, the strongest and most durable infantry in the lizardmen roster. they are halberd infantry meaning they can take on large units as well as having sheilds, meaning they are very good at defending. <br />
      In the warhammer fantasy lore, temple guard are selected from the strongest of the saurus armies to defend Slaan mage priests and their star chambers from villainous intruders who would seek to harm their masters. <br />
      This role carries over in game, as they are best used to protect your fragile casters, so they can do as much damage as possible, while preventing counterattacks.
      <br />
      <h2>KROXIGOR INFANTRY</h2>
      Now, finally we have the mighty kroxigor. Giant, burly, bipedal crocodiles with an aptitude for big hammers and magic punching gloves.
      <br />
      Both variants are made the most useful if instead of sending them in alone, have them suppliment your saurus infantry. this gives them the opportunity to do good damage without being surrounded by enemies.

    >
    <br />
    These are sacred kroxigors, they have power fists, they are awesome.
    <br />
    Even though standard kroxigors are fun on their own, a crocodile that punches things with magic boxing gloves is <b>far</b> superior.
