    <p>
      Large monsters are cool, this is a simple fact of life that nobody can
      disprove. witnessing as a masterfully created army of highly trained
      warriors be bulldozed by an army of giant lizards will never not make me
      happy. <br />
      On this site, i will attempt to go over the strengths and weaknesses about
      many of these sneaky snakes, combat crocodiles, and Supersized Saurus, and
      which ones you should use in your worldwide conquests.
