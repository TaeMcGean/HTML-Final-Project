    <p>
      Large monsters are cool, this is a simple fact of life that nobody can
      disprove. witnessing as a masterfully created army of highly trained
      warriors be bulldozed by an army of giant lizards will never not make me
      happy. <br />
      On this site, i will attempt to go over the strengths and weaknesses about
      many of these sneaky snakes, combat crocodiles, and Supersized Saurus, and
      which ones you should use in your worldwide conquests.

    <h3>Doomstacking (Strategy be damned, give me more dinosaurs!)</h3>
    <p>
      Constructing an army is hard work, it requires actual thinking and tactics
      to win battles.
      <br />
      But, what if it didnt have to be? why not make an army of 19 t-rexes? 19
      stegasauruses with ballistas?
      <br />
      well,dont you worry, because you can do that, and here i will show off
      some of the strongest options for your big dumb dino destruction balls!
